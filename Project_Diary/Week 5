- Sketched designs for interfaces 
- Started creating prototypes and designs.
- Decided I'll probably make two versions of website and decide which is better at a later date
- Decided I'll make the use of Three.js redundant as it is a language that I would need more time to master with the time allocated to me for this team project.
